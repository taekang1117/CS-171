- at some task
- with experience

## Examples
* Google Photos 
> Uses machine learning to automatically categorize photos into different classes

* Stock Market Prediction
* Image Captioning
* Self-driving Car
* Mind Reading
* Recommender Systems
* Credit Card Fraud Detection
* Computational Entomology
> Given sensor measurements of insects classify them by species/gender

## What Is Data Mining?
Knowledge discovery from data 
* Extraction of ***interesting*** (non-trival, implicit, previously unkown, and potentially useful) patterns or knowldege from huge amounts of data

Alternative names
* Data science, knowledge discovery (mining) in databases (KDD), knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, business intelligence, etc.
